<h1>Portfolio</h1>
<p>Version one of my portfolio. I decided against using a template as I want to build the whole thing from scratch. I am not very 
skilled on the creative side of making web pages, so the design is still up in the air. Playing around with different designs and color
plattes.</p> 

<p>Page is deployed on google pages, but I decided to add an email form in to the contact page, in order for people to send me direct emails.
I needed a way to handle the POST from the form and the sending of the email. I used a FLASK backend for now, as this is what I am most 
experienced with. The site has also been deployed to Heroku. This will be where the site lives. I am going to remove the github pages shortly, 
as the email feature will not work from github pages.</p> 

<p>Still have a lot of work to do to make the site more responsive, a lot of time was put into trying to come up with a design this week, which 
will also be changing a lot. Comments soon to come as well, once the site is more fleshed out.</p>
